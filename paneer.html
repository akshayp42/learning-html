<h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
      <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
      <li>450g paneer, cut into 3cm cubes</li>
      <li>500g spinach, mature fresh or frozen</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves</li>
<li>thumb-sized piece of ginger</li>
<li>1 green chilli, roughly chopped, (include seeds for extra spice)</li>
<li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
<li>Â½ lemon, juiced, to serve</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Method:</h2>
<ol>
<p><li>Melt the ghee, whisk in with the turmeric and chilli powder, then add the cubed paneer and toss well. Set aside. If using frozen spinach, microwave for 3-5 mins, then place in a sieve and squeeze out most of the water. If using fresh spinach, place in a colander, pour over boiling water, drain and cool, then put in a tea towel and squeeze out most of the water. Roughly chop</li></p>
<p><li>Blitz the onion with the garlic, ginger and green chilli. Cook the paneer in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat for around 8 mins, tossing the pan so they become golden all over. Remove and set aside on a plate, leaving spices behind in the pan. Tip the onion mix into the pan, add a pinch of salt and turn the heat down. Fry until caramel coloured, around 10 mins, adding a splash of water if it looks a little dry. Add the garam masala, stir to coat the onion mix, fry for 2 mins</li></p>
<p><li>Add the spinach and cook for a further 2-3 mins, adding 100ml water to release all the flavours from the bottom of the pan. Add the paneer and cook for 2-3 mins to heat through. Spoon into bowls and squeeze over a little lemon juice, to serve.</li></p>
